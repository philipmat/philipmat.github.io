title: Status Updates

As a consultant, I'm occasionally responsible for leading a team. As humble developer I'm occasionally part of a team. 
In either case, I do care about what my team is working on and the daily status updates practiced in Agile are only 
in my memory until the meeting is over (sometimes longer if I remembered to bring a notebook).

What I'd like to see instead, at any point in time, is one, or all, of three things:

1. what is my team  or team members *currently* working on;
2. what will my team or team members work on *next*;
3. what has my team *been* working on.

I want all this information to be easily available, most of the time at a glance (especially for the first point), and I want it brief.
