Structured procrastination
> "... anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn't the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment." -- Robert Benchley, in Chips off the Old Benchley, 1949

>  The key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing. Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing; they do marginally useful things, like gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they get around to it. Why does the procrastinator do these things? Because they are a way of not doing something more important. If all the procrastinator had left to do was to sharpen some pencils, no force on earth could get him do it. However, the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important.

Playing video games - difficult bosses push me back to coding.

> Structured procrastination means shaping the structure of the tasks one has to do in a way that exploits this fact. The list of tasks one has in mind will be ordered by importance. Tasks that seem most urgent and important are on top. But there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower down on the list. Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher up on the list. With this sort of appropriate task structure, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen.

> The trick is to pick the right sorts of projects for the top of the list. The ideal sorts of things have two characteristics, First, they seem to have clear deadlines (but really don't). Second, they seem awfully important (but really aren't). Luckily, life abounds with such tasks.


Hemingway

> When I am working on a book or a story I write every morning as soon after first light as possible. 
> There is no one to disturb you and it is cool or cold and you come to your work and warm as you write. 
> You read what you have written and, as you always stop when you know what is going to happen next, you go on from there. 
> You write until you come to a place where you still have your juice and know what will happen next 
> and you stop and try to live through until the next day when you hit it again. 
> You have started at six in the morning, say, and may go on until noon or be through before that. 
> When you stop you are as empty, and at the same time never empty but filling, 
> as when you have made love to someone you love. Nothing can hurt you, nothing can happen, 
> nothing means anything until the next day when you do it again. 
> It is the wait until the next day that is hard to get through.



> INTERVIEWER
> 
> But are there times when the inspiration isnâ€™t there at all?
> 
> HEMINGWAY
> 
> Naturally. But if you stopped when you knew what would happen next, you can go on. As long as you can start, you are all right. The juice will come.

> You can write any time people will leave you alone and not interrupt you. Or rather you can if you will be ruthless enough about it. But the best writing is certainly when you are in love.


Seinfeld
> He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. 
> "After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. 
> You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. 
> Your only job next is to not break the chain."
> 
> "Don't break the chain," he said again for emphasis.
