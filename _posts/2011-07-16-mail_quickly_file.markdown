title: Quickly Move Messages In Mail.app

This trick uses OS X's superb *search in menus* feature and since all your mail folders are available as menus entries under **Message > Move To**, it makes it really quick and easy to perform this operation.

If you use Gmail, remember that labels are available as folder so think of this as a less elegant way to label your messages.

1. Press `Cmd-?` or `Cmd-Shift-/` to access the **Help > Search** menu. <sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>
2. Type in the name of your folder.
3. Press arrow down once for **Move To** or twice for **Copy To** and hit return.
