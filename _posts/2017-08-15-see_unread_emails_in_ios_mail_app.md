snippet: How to make available a special folder that dynamically shows unread emails

I don't aim for Inbox Zero, but I aim to read all the emails I receive,
however, with default setting the iOS Mail app does not make it easy.

For a while, it seemed that the only way to find unread emails and get
that red badge to disappear was to scroll through the inboxes and try
to find the emails with a blue dot to their left.

Turns out there's a better way and that indeed the iOS Mail app has
a folder aka *smart mailbox* which tracks all unread emails across all your accounts.

To enable this mailbox:

1. In the *Mailboxes* screen (the one with all the folders), tap the *Edit*
   button up in the top-right corner;
2. The screen switches to edit mode, displaying a list of current (visible)
   and available mailboxes. From this list select the *Unread* mailbox;
   I also like to drag it all the way up to the top.
3. Tap the *Done* button and you're done!

Here's a visual that shows these steps:

The configuration does not sync across devices, so if you also have an iPad,
you'll need to repeat these steps on those other devices.
