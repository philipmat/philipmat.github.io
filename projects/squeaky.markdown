# What Is Squeaky?
*Squeaky* is a web proxy, in the spirit of [a2](http://a2.com) or [PHProxy](http://phproxy)

# Why Squeaky?

1. Because PHProxy is no longer maintained;
2. Because the (probably superior) glyde is not open source;
3. Because a2 has some crap I didn't care about;
4. Because a2 was not on [github](http://github.com/philipmat/squeaky/).

# Where Can I Get Squeaky?
On [github](http://github.com/philipmat/squeaky/).

# How Do I Run It?
If your webserver already support PHP, clone it or drop it in a folder. Access the folder. Done

# TODO List
1. Remove more of the files and code the project doesn't need.
