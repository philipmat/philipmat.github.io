# What Is Squeaky

**Squeaky** is a web proxy, in the spirit of [a2](http://a2.com) or [PHProxy](http://phproxy)

## Why Squeaky

- Because your company blocked access to your daily dose of [lolcats](http://icanhascheezburger.com/);
- Because PHProxy is no longer maintained;
- Because the (probably superior) glyde is not open source;
- Because a2 has some crap I didn't care about;
- Because a2 was not on [github](http://github.com/philipmat/squeaky/).

## Where Can I Get Squeaky

On [github](http://github.com/philipmat/squeaky/).

## How Do I Run It

If your webserver already supports PHP, clone it or drop it in a folder. Access the folder. Done.

## TODO List

1. Remove more of the files and code the project doesn't need.
2. Set the original URL as the `title` on generated links.
